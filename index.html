<p>
    <span>Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    </span>
    <span> <i>Ipsum</i>has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
        make
        a type specimen book.
    </span>
    <span>It has <b>survived</b> not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    </span>

    <span> was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing
        <span> Lorem </span>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
        including
        versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.
    </span>
